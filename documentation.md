## Setup & Population of DB

### Table Creation

```
CREATE TABLE Departments ( 
id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY, 
DeptName VARCHAR(50), 
HeadProfessorID INT 
); 
CREATE TABLE Professors ( 
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
FirstName NVARCHAR(100), 
LastName NVARCHAR(100), 
Department_ID VARCHAR(10), 
FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES Departments(id) 
); 
CREATE TABLE Students ( 
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
FirstName NVARCHAR(100), 
LastName NVARCHAR(100), 
DoB DATE, 
EnrolmentYear INT 
); 
CREATE TABLE Courses ( 
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
CourseName VARCHAR(50), 
Department_ID VARCHAR(10), 
FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES Departments(id) 
); 
CREATE TABLE StudentEnrollments ( 
StudentID INT, 
CourseID INT, 
FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(id), 
FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(id), 
PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID) 
);
```

### Altering Foreign Key

Foreign key connecting tables **Departments (Department Head)** with **Professors (ID)** had to be added subsequently to avoid conflicts with circular references:

```
ALTER TABLE Departments
ADD FOREIGN KEY (HeadProfessorID) REFERENCES Professors(id);
```

### Database Population

The following queries populates (details generated by OpenAI) our demo database with students, courses, departments and professors. It then fills the junction table (representing a *MANY-TO-MANY* relationship between Students and Courses) **StudentEnrollments** with data, making sure several students are enrolled in several courses.

```

## Querying The Database

### Student Enrollment Info

In order to gather information on a specific student enrollment, run the following query:

```
SELECT Courses.coursename, Students.FirstName, Students.LastName
FROM Courses
JOIN StudentEnrollments ON Courses.id = StudentEnrollments.CourseID
JOIN Students ON StudentEnrollments.StudentID = Students.id
WHERE Students.id = 6;
```

The table printed shows the *coursename*, *student first name* and *student last name* related to student with student-ID '6'.

### Professor Department Association

The following query counts (COUNT) the amount of professors belonging to each department and prints a table showcasing each department and the sum of professors associated with the department.

```
SELECT departments.id AS DepartmentID, Departments.DeptName, COUNT(Professors.id) AS ProfessorCount
FROM Departments
LEFT JOIN Professors ON Departments.id = Professors.Department_ID
GROUP BY Departments.id, Departments.DeptName;
```

### Course Offers for Each Department

This query uses GROUP BY and the CONCAT method to retrieve and display all courses connected to each department. **GROUP_CONCAT** makes sure the field "Courses" adds all courses together in one string, separated by one comma.

**GROUP BY** groups all courses together that shares the same department ID.

```
SELECT Departments.deptname AS Department,
group_concat(Courses.coursename) AS Courses
FROM Departments
JOIN Courses ON Courses.Department_ID = Departments.id
GROUP BY Departments.deptname;
```

### Head of Each Department

Finally, this query retrieves the head professor assigned to each department.

```
SELECT Departments.id, Departments.DeptName, Professors.FirstName AS HeadFirstName, Professors.LastName as HeadLastName
FROM Departments
JOIN Professors ON Departments.HeadProfessorID = Professors.id;
```

## Modifying Data

### Adding a New Professor

Use the following query to add a new professor to the database:

The primary key "ID" auto increments, and tehrefore requires no definition. Note that the *department ID* is of data type *string*.

```
INSERT INTO professors(FirstName, LastName, Department_ID)
VALUES ("Stefan", "Goransson", 'ENG05');
```

### Assigning a New Head Professor

To assign a new head of a department, the UPDATE syntax is required.

```
UPDATE departments
SET headprofessorid = 11
WHERE id = 'MATH20';
```

This sets the new head of MATH20 to our newly added professor at professor ID 11.

### Registering a New Student for a Course

To add a new student and then enroll them to a course, two separate sql queries are needed.

**Adding a student:**

```
insert into students(firstname, lastname, dob, enrolmentyear)
values ('Valdemar', 'Sersam', '1994-06-14', 2023))
```

**Enrolling them:**

```
INSERT INTO StudentEnrollments (StudentID, CourseID)
SELECT id, 3
FROM Students
WHERE FirstName = 'Valdemar' AND LastName = 'Sersam';
```

This enrolls our newly added student to Chemistry 101, with course ID 3. SELECT id is used to allow the insertion to use the name of the students instead of the ID.

### Adding a New Course

Adding a course is simple and is carried out with an INSERT statement as follows:

```
INSERT INTO courses(coursename, department_id)
VALUES ('Nuclear Bomb Development', 'CHEM15');
```
